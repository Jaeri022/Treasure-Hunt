What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer Scientists help develop technology forward in order to both solve and improve on a problem the world current faces. They must also try to adapt with any current trends/changes happening in the world today and be made aware of any further developments that could end up hurting more people than helping.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I first start by identifying a goal or problem I would be facing. Then, I research any past developments that attempted to solve the problem before, learning upon this data to help guide my project. Finally, after developing a program bit by bit and testing to see if it still meets the end goal standards, I try to identify any other possible uses/features that could be added while also trying to add security for protection.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

The ethical responsibilities I face first and foremost is to reduce as much information leaking to unathorized persons as much as possible. I must also try to keep any bias away from any programs I end up developing, as to not end up harming the end user. Finally, I should be transparent with the end user or organization with how both the algorithm works and any data that ends up being used for the user, having them agree upon the data before continuing using the program.
